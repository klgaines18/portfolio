      <h2>About Katie</h2>
      <p>I am an alum of Clemson University with a degree in Biosystems Engineering. One of my favorite hobbies is hiking, so when I went to college I wanted to find a degree that had the potential to spend a lot of time outside. Life doesn't always go according to plan.</p>
        <p>After graduating and getting married I was moving around a bit due to my husband's job, so I decided to take the time to start a family before starting my career. I am now the mother of two beautiful little girls who constantly keep me on my toes.</p>
      <p>When I started job searching however, I didn't feel a job in the field I hold my degree in was the best fit. With the world changing I wanted to find something that had the potential to be done remotely. I took a few progamming classes in college, my favorite had a project programming a robot to play against you in tic-tac-toe. I remember absolutely loving these classes, but didn't persue a career in that field at the time because I was still set on finding something that would get me outside.</p>
      <p>Life changes, goals change, and we adapt. I am now pursuing my old love for programming, and hope to go far with it.</p>
